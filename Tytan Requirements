Hey buddy, Please, work on the branch you just created. You will not be able to commit changes on the main branch as you require to make it as a main repo.
So from now on we will work on your branch "developmentBranch", and when we will be satisfied with our change we will push it to main, and from there 
we will deploy to the server. :) ...

Good Job buddy.
